# Authorship-Attribution
### Given the stylometric (keyword list), chronological (year) and locational (venue) features of a paper,we performed the authorship attribution on multi-author documents by  predicting the probability of a target being the true author/coauthor of the paper. We approached this classification problem from two angles: multi-class VS multi-label classification.
